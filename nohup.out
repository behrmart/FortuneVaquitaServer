If all Russians talk\nas much as the Karamazovs did, I don't see how they found time to become a\nmajor world power.\n\tI'm told that Dostoyevsky wrote \"The Brothers Karamazov\" to raise\nthe question of whether there is a God.  So why didn't he just come right\nout and say: \"Is there a God? It sure beats the heck out of me.\"\n\tOther famous works could easily have been summarized in a few words:\n\n* \"Moby Dick\" -- Don't mess around with large whales because they symbolize\n  nature and will kill you.\n* \"A Tale of Two Cities\" -- French people are crazy.\n\t\t-- Dave Barry\n"]}
